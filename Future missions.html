  <h1>ISRO Future Missions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Mission 1: Gaganyaan</h2>
      <p>
        Gaganyaan is an Indian crewed orbital spacecraft intended to be the formative spacecraft of the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. The spacecraft is being designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capability. In its maiden crewed mission, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s largely autonomous 5.3 metric tonnes capsule will orbit the Earth at 400 km altitude for up to seven days with a two or three-person crew on board

      <h2>Mission2:Chandrayaan-3</h2>
      <p>
        Chandrayaan-3   is a planned third lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It will consist of a lander and a rover similar to Chandrayaan-2, but would not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module will behave like a communications relay satellite. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100km lunar orbit

      <h2>Mission-3:Mars orbiter mission </h2>
      <p>
        Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (MOM 2), also called Mangalyaan-2 is India's second interplanetary mission planned by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In a recorded interview in October 2019, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) director indicated possibility of inclusion of a lander but in an interview to The Times Of India in February 2021 ISRO chairman clarified that the mission will consist of only an orbiter.The orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an orbit more suitable for observations.
